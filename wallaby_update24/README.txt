~~~~~~~~ Welcome ~~~~~~~~~~~
This folder contains a wallaby_update.sh script which can be used to update the KIPR Robot Controller "Wallaby".   The script can be run by executing ./wallaby_update.sh from the same folder as this README.


~~~~~~~~ Terminology ~~~~~~~~~~~
* botui: the touchscreen robot interface
* harrogate: the web browser robot interface
* libwallaby: the library of functions that provides motor(), servo(), digital(), etc

~~~~~~~~ Update Log ~~~~~~~~~~~


Version 24 Fixes/Features:
* Harrogate: disabling buttons during run and compile to avoid run/stop/compile glitches
* Harrogate: updated libwallaby docs
* libwallaby: new functions in compass.h  See Modules->Compass in the Documentation (via the help button)
* python: fixing error during compile step
* update/upgrade: fixing "current partition" detection in scripts
* update: hash checking of update files


Version 24 Known Issues
* python: info display from new compass functions are not visible unless you manually stop the program
* python: Syntax highlighting is not switching to Python mode for python projects
* We have a good calibration for our batteries, but differences between boards in the sensing circuit will require further (per-board) calibration in order to have good battery capacity feedback.
* The battery level starts out at 100% when botui starts, and may take a minute to drop to the correct voltage.
​* The camera needs to be close to QR codes, and recognition may be shaky. This is due to our low resolution. A different camera at 320x240 worked better
The spin box in "Settings -> Camera View --> Show blob labels" is small and difficult to change
* The option to revert botui to non-fullscreen mode does not apply to the home screen
* If you use the "hide UI" button to access the terminal, there isn't an easy way to get back to botui


Version 23 Fixes/Features:
* The controller will automatically switch to using an external HDMI display on boot if one is plugged in. This is only checked once at boot and will disable the touchscreen until the next reboot.
* Harrogate: There is a new per-user "Simple/Advanced Interface" setting, which is set to simple by default.  This simplifies the IDE user interface to the essentials. It can be changed on the "User Preferences" page.  Previous controller firmware versions were somewhere in the middle, but closer to the "Advanced" setting.
* Harrogate: The runner is no longer part of the normal workflow.  Programs can be executed without leaving the IDE coding ("KISS IDE") page
* Harrogate: A link indicator in the bottom right corner will change to a broken link icon if communication with the server/controller is disturbed.
* Harrogate: The About now goes to an about page
* Harrogate: The Help button now goes documentation for libwallaby
* Harrogate: Users can delete source/include/data files from the Project Explorer (in addition to the file menu page)
* Harrogate: There are confirmation dialogues for deleting users/projects/files
* Harrogate: Users and Projects are sorted in drop-downs
* Harrogate: We now reset the text entries when re-opening the "Create Project" menu
* Harrogate: When a new user is created, we switch to that user
* Harrogate: When switching users, we close/hide any code that was displayed previously for another user
* Harrogate: Four space code auto indent to be consistent with the starting program template and our teaching material
* Libwallaby: Support for the black 2017 logitech camera at up to 30 fps at 160x120 or 320x240 pixels.
* Libwallaby: Removing program output spam messages generated by calling get_motor_done()
* Botui: On the "Motors and Sensors"->"Motors" page we now use the correct mav()/motor_power() functions.  This fixes a bug introduced in v21 when the motor() function changed to being based on mav()

* Most users will use the "upgrade" method involving a full SD card wipe


Version 21 Fixes/Features:

* Enabled QR channels in libwallaby and botui
* Fixed polarity of get_servo_enabled
* Implemented blob confidence for HSV channels
* Camera viewer can now label blobs according to their blob number. The number of blobs to label is configurable through Settings -> Camera View. The default is 0. Since this is a new feature, I'm interested in any feedback.
* Bounding boxes in camera viewer can be toggled through Settings -> Camera View. The default is ON.
